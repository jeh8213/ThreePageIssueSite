            <span>Breakfast for dinner is exactly how it sounds. Instead of eating something nice and rather complicated for your last meal of the day, why not just eat breakfast food? Breakfast IS the most important meal of the day, and it wouldn’t hurt to have twice. It’s also healthier to have a light breakfast meal with the nutrients that you need. Especially for students in college, eating something simple for dinner is cheaper and easier to make. It requires less ingredients, plus it can help with overeating.Though studies show that eating breakfast for dinner is better for our weight, other sources show that there is overall no difference in weight loss between people who eat small dinners versus people who eat large dinners. The reason for this is pretty unclear, for it could quite possibly be either in relation to our circadian rhythm or the fact that our body digests food differently in different times of the day.</span>
